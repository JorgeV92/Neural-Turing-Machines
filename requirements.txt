 A brief description of what each part of this structure does:

data/: Contains the data that your project uses. This is typically split into training and testing sets.

neural_turing_machine/: This is the main package for your project, containing the NTM implementation.

__init__.py: This is a special Python file that lets Python know that this directory should be treated as a package. It can be empty.

ntm.py: This file contains the implementation of the main Neural Turing Machine class.

controller.py: This file contains the implementation of the controller network.

read_head.py: This file contains the implementation of the read head.

write_head.py: This file contains the implementation of the write head.

memory.py: This file contains the implementation of the write head.

scripts/: Contains standalone scripts for training and evaluation.

train.py: This script can be run to train your model.

evaluate.py: This script can be run to evaluate your model.

tests/: Contains unit tests for your project.

.gitignore: This file tells Git which files or directories to ignore in your project.

LICENSE: The license for your project.

README.md: The README for your project, which includes information on what your project does and how to use it.

requirements.txt: This file lists all of the Python packages that your project depends on.
