# Neural Turing Machines

Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) are a kind of recurrent neural network (RNN) that utilizes external memory resources. This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of NTMs.

## Project Description

This project is an implementation of the Neural Turing Machine, as proposed in the paper "Neural Turing Machines" by Graves, Wayne, and Danihelka. The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning model that can learn to infer and execute simple algorithms, extending beyond the capabilities of typical sequence-to-sequence models.

## Installation

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch 1.x
- Numpy

**Installation Steps:**
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Neural-Turing-Machines.git


2. Install the necessary packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

## Documentation

Include a link to your documentation here, if you have it hosted elsewhere. If not, you should include some basic usage examples and/or API reference in this README.

## Contributing

Explain whether and how others can contribute to your project.

## License

Include a note about the license you're releasing your code under. If you're unsure which license to use, GitHub provides a [licensing guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) that can help.

## Contact

Let people know how to reach you, in case they want to communicate with you about your project.

## Acknowledgements

Give proper credits to the authors of the paper, and any other resources you used while developing your project.
The content of each section will depend on your project's specifics. The most important thing is to clearly communicate what your project is for and how to use it. This helps others understand your work and can encourage them to contribute.
