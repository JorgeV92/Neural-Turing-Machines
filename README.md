Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) are a kind of recurrent neural network (RNN) that utilizes external memory resources. This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of NTMs.

## Project Description

This project is an implementation of the Neural Turing Machine, as proposed in the paper "Neural Turing Machines" by Graves, Wayne, and Danihelka. The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning model that can learn to infer and execute simple algorithms, extending beyond the capabilities of typical sequence-to-sequence models.

## Installation
